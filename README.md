# Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing banking data to derive insights that inform business decisions. It integrates SQL for data management and visualizations created using Power BI, providing a comprehensive analytical approach.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of banking transactions, offering valuable insights into customer behavior and trends. It includes variables such as transaction amount, date, customer demographics, and more.

## Tools
- **Python**: For data manipulation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- **SQL**: To load and manage the dataset.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For performing EDA and data cleaning.
- **Power BI**: To create interactive dashboards for data visualization.

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to explore data insights easily. It features various visualizations, including charts and graphs, that highlight key metrics and trends in the dataset.

## Results
The analysis reveals significant trends in customer transactions, helping to identify growth opportunities and areas for improvement in banking services. Insights drawn from the data can inform strategic decisions and optimize customer engagement.

## How to Run

1. **Set Up SQL Database**:
   - Load the dataset into your SQL database.
   - Ensure you have the required permissions to access the database.

2. **Connect to Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Install necessary Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sqlalchemy`, `matplotlib`, etc.
   - Connect to the SQL database in your Jupyter Notebook.

3. **Run the EDA and Data Cleaning**:
   - Execute the provided Python scripts to perform EDA and data cleaning.

4. **Create Power BI Dashboard**:
   - Import the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
   - Build the dashboard using the insights generated from the analysis.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to effectively load, analyze, and visualize banking data, providing actionable insights for stakeholders. Feel free to explore the code and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of data analytics in practice.
